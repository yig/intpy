This package provides types and functions for Maximum Accuracy Interval Arithmetic.

The Interval Arithmetic is a mathematical tool for the solution of problems related to numerical errors, based on an algebraic system formed by all closed intervals of Real Line (or rectangles of Complex Plane) and operations defined on it. Rather than usual numerical algorithms, it's used interval algorithms producing intervals containing the correct answer as a result.

The Maximum Accuracy, on the other hand, provides an axiomatic method for arithmetic operations performed in computers that capture essential properties associated with rounding.

Currently only Real Intervals are available. No Complex Intervals, no Interval Vectors and Matrixes, and no extensions of basic functions. These will be our next work.

It was developed at CIn/UFPE (Brazil) by Rafael Menezes Barreto <rmb3@cin.ufpe.br, rafaelbarreto87@gmail.com> and it's free software.
